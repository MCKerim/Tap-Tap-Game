# Tap Tap Game
 This is a mobile game which was developed by me alone with the Unity game engine. In this game you have to tap all opponents quickly or you lose. There are many different opponents and game modes. It looks simple but there is a lot more behind it. The goal in the development was to keep the rules and controls simple and still ensure long lasting fun for the player.
